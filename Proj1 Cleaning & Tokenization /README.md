# Cleaning & Tokenization
Clean a file and count the words in it that uses:
1. NLTK's word_tokenizer and porter
stemmer after cleaning out the tags, but before counting the tokens.
2. Also, write own Porter Stemmer referencing https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/def.txt the original Porter Stemmer paper that describes the
algorithm in detail.

The code is in Python3 (version 3.0 or higher will work). The only other requirement is: <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a> & <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html">regex</a>
