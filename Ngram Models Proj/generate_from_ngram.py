'''
    Unigram:
        Generate a random number from 0.0 to 1.0, and begin to count up the
        probabilities for the unigrams. When you reach the unigram whose probability sends
        the probability total above the random number, add that unigram to the sentence.
        Repeat.
        Sentences should begin with <s> and end with </s>, and not have any <s>s or
        </s>s between the start and end.

    Findings: 
        Create bigram and trigram dictionaries to tackle the problem which makes sense and is also faster!
